<p><img src="digigil.png" width="250" height="250" align="right" />I will post informative stuff here for my clients. I thank you for stopping by, and hope answers can be found easily. This will be slow and going at first, but will build to bigger and brighter helpful tools you can reference from here!

Here's my first bit of knowledge I'd like to share. Consider your PC to be a top fuel dragster that usually performs awesome, except if you don't have any fuel for that high performance engine (CPU) than it isn't going down that 1/4 mile very far! Follow me here one step further.

Remember, this website is for wiser computer users. Anyone remember Gumby? If you do, you should remember the blockheads as well! Well, the blockhead, cube, needs to know that when a CPU computes three dimensional space, that cube isn't calculated by Celerons or Semprons, quicker than us, but not as quick as a math-co CPU. So when you first purchase your PC's make sure you buy a Pentium dual core, or AMD A-8 minimum for your best chance at just surfing the web. The amount and mass of data coming into your PC is far too much for the aforementioned CPU's!

Well, that's a start. Welcome to my webpage.
